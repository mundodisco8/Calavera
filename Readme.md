# Calavera Badge

One of these days I will make a proper README. In the meantime, just mention that there are two parts that can be used for the soldermask:

- Calavera_Soldermask_1200dpi_No_Border
- Calavera_Soldermask_1200dpi_Border

The first one has a nice silkscreen contour that gives it a more "elegant" look, and the second one goes full bling by exposing .5mm of soldermask to give it a nice golden contour. I did this because PCBWay gives you the option to plate the sides at no cost, so I went with that and thought that it would look good with the sides plated. Choose your poison.
